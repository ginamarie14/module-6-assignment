This app is a simple weather app using the free weather APIs made available by Open-Meteo.

The user is able to see the weather for any city they may search for. The user will be provided with current conditions, as well as the next 5-day forecast. Information includes the Temperature, UV Index, Humidity, and Wind Speed.

The user has a search history that is shown and that they can refer to in order to quickly look up a previously searched city.

The data is sourced from OpenWeather Map.
